🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment Series
Welcome to the OOP Assignment Series – a collection of structured Python assignments designed to help you master the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in a clear, practical, and step-by-step manner.

Each assignment in this series targets a specific OOP principle, making it a perfect resource for beginners and intermediate learners who want to strengthen their programming foundation.

📚 What You’ll Learn
This repository covers the following major OOP topics:

#	Topic	Description
1	Classes and Objects	Understand how to define and use classes and instances.
2	Constructors and Instance Variables	Learn how constructors (__init__) and object data work.
3	Inheritance	Implement code reuse and extension using inheritance.
4	Method Overriding	Customize behavior in child classes.
5	Class Methods and Static Methods	Know when and how to use @classmethod and @staticmethod.
6	Composition	Understand "has-a" relationships between classes.
7	Aggregation	Hold references to independent objects inside a class.
8	Method Resolution Order (MRO)	See how Python resolves methods with multiple inheritance.
9	Decorators (Function & Class)	Learn how to modify behavior of functions and classes.
10	Property Decorators	Use @property, setters, and deleters to manage attributes.
11	Callable Objects	Make class instances behave like functions using __call__.
12	Custom Exceptions	Create and handle your own error types.
13	Iterators and __iter__	Make classes iterable using __iter__ and __next__.
